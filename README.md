# my-works

Here I will upload a vast amount of the creations that I'm going to make in my journey to become a professional programmer:

* Competitive programming stuff.
* Problems from books.
* Small projects.
* Possibly, extracts from contributions to other projects.

You can use my works as long as you comply with the GNU General Public License (i.e. you have many freedoms and you don't need to request anything from me, but I would greatly appreciate if you mention me ^-^)
